# CSS - Cascading Stylesheets (Style)

## 3 ways to style with CSS

- Inline -> putting the style attribute directly on the element
  - not recommended (last resort)
  - old way
  - only used if you cannot use the other two ways

- Internal -> uses a style tag
  - Selector - what elements do you want to style?
  - Rule - how do you want to style them?
  - styles one page
  - not recommended

- External -> link in the head
  - Selector - what elements do you want to style?
  - Rule - how do you want to style them?
  - can be used in multiple HTML files

- Priority
  - Inline - most
  - Internal - based on order listed (last wins)
  - External - based on order listed (last wins)
